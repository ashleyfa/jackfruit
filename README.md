ICS314 Team JackFruit

The team consisted of Kai Okimoto, Blake Villas, and Ashley Fagaragan. We developed a text-based application for our class, ICS 314. The application resembles a calendar. The application takes a certain date and creates an event, searches for free time in your calendar for that day. The applications can also add descriptions to a single event such as location, etc.
